#### Problem #1: Encoding messages so that they are more secure. ####
#
# Create a Function named encode that takes two arguments: text and key.
# 
# Python functions use the syntax
# def functionName (arguments):
#     The function code here
#
#     return variable


#### Problem #2: Decoding messages. ####
#
# Create a Function named decode that takes two arguments: text and key.
# This function should take the text and decode it using the key value provided.

def decode (text, key):
    # Your Code Here


#### Problem #3: Decoding messages without the key. ####
#
# Create a Function that decodes the message using brute force. The best way to
# do this is to try all 26 combinations and let the user figure out what the likely message is.

def brute (text):
    # Your Code Here
