#### Python functions use the syntax. ####
# def functionName (arguments):
#     The function code here.
#
#     return variable


#### Python loops use the syntax. ####
# for item in list:
#   Do things to each item.

## They also use the syntax. ##
# for i in range(num):
#   Do things num times.


#### Python conditionals use the syntax. ####
# if (condition):
#   Do this.
# elif (condition):
#   Do this instead.
# else:
#   Do this if nothing else is true.




#### Problem #1: Encoding messages so that they are more secure. ####
# Create a Function named encode that takes two arguments: text and key.




#### Problem #2: Decoding messages. ####
# Create a Function named decode that takes two arguments: text and key.
# This function should take the text and decode it using the key value provided.

def decode (text, key):
    # Your Code Here


#### Problem #3: Decoding messages without the key. ####
# Create a Function that decodes the message using brute force. The best way to
# do this is to try all 26 combinations and let the user figure out what the likely message is.

def brute (text):
    # Your Code Here
